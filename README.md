In this project, we are going to learn the interfacing of the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Ranging Module. This module works on the principle of Radar. This sensor has 4 pins which are: Echo, Trigger, Vcc and GND. This sensor gives the time delay between the transmission and reception of the acoustic waves generated by the sensor itself and by using this reading we calculate the distance of the object by doing simple calculations. The calculations are done by using the speed of light in air which is a known quantity and it is divided by 2 as the wave travels the same distance twice during transmission and reception.

In this project we are going to recreate a parking assistant installed in cars which indicates how much is the distance of our car from nearby objects avoiding collision. Firstly we will interface the Ultrasonic sensor with Arduino UNO and after that we connect LEDs and piezo buzzer with Arduino. The code works in such a manner that for particular ranges of distance a particular set of LEDs lights up and buzzer also makes different sounds according to the distance.
